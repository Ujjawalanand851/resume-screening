Why Resume Screening?

Companies manually receive and review thousands of resumes for every job posting.

Resumes are categorized and forwarded to hiring teams, consuming significant time.

Manually screening hundreds of resumes becomes inefficient and slow.

Machine learning and NLP drastically reduce screening time from days to minutes.

Automated screening improves accuracy, consistency, and hiring efficiency.

Introduction

Resume screening is the process of evaluating whether a candidate is suitable for a job role based on their:

Education

Experience

Skills

Achievements

Additional resume details

It works as a pattern-matching system between job requirements and candidate qualifications.

The goal is to:

Shortlist strong candidates

Filter out unqualified ones

Improve hiring workflow

Modules & Libraries
Modules

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):
A supervised learning model used for classification based on similarity.

NLP (Natural Language Processing):
Enables the model to understand, analyze, and process human language.

Libraries

NumPy – Numerical computation

Pandas – Data handling & preprocessing

Matplotlib – Plotting & visualizations

Seaborn – Statistical visualizations

SciPy – Scientific computing

Scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms

NLTK – Text preprocessing & language analysis

Functionality

The system screens resumes based on both minimum and preferred qualifications, including:

Work experience

Education

Skills & knowledge

Competencies

Personality traits

These parameters help determine whether a candidate fits the job role.

Tools & Technologies

Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence

Text Mining

Natural Language Processing

Applicant Tracking System (ATS) concepts

These technologies automate and streamline the resume screening process.

Tech Innovations

Modern AI-driven screening tools are designed to:

Reduce manual candidate filtering

Automate resume classification

Integrate with existing HR systems

Increase hiring speed and efficiency

Minimize human bias and errors

AI is transforming how recruiters evaluate resumes and shortlist candidates.

Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/ujjawalanand851/Resume-Screening.git
cd Resume-Screening
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare your dataset of resumes

Preprocess the data using the available scripts

Train the machine learning model

Use the trained model to screen new resumes

Detailed instructions and demonstrations are available in the Jupyter notebooks included in the repository.

Dataset

The dataset consists of resumes collected from various sources.
Data is preprocessed to extract features such as:

Technical skills

Work experience

Education

Keywords

Relevant profile attributes

Model

This project includes multiple machine learning models such as:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines

Random Forest

Neural Networks

Each model is trained and evaluated on labeled resume data.

Results

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

All results, visualizations, and comparisons are documented within the project notebooks.
